This repo contains my crash course on PHP. I did it in multiple stages.

- The first stage involved gaining general familiarity with PHP using [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
    - The [`oop`](./oop) and [`scripts`](./scripts) directories contain scripts that I was handling in this stage.
- And finally a crash course on Laravel from [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/)
    - The [`blog`](./blog) directory is the Laracasts course.
